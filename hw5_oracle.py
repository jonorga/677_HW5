# TODO: Get CMG and SPY files


# Question 1.1 =================================================================================================
# TODO: For each of the five years
	# TODO: Compute mean and standard deviation for all weeks, negative weeks, and non negative weeks


# Question 1.2 =================================================================================================
# TODO: take data from question 1.1 and generate tables for each year


# Question 1.3 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Are there more weeks with negative or non-negative returns in total?


# Question 1.4 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Is the absolute value of the average returns greater for negative or non-negative returns?


# Question 2 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Answers from analyzing tables


# Question 3 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Compute aggregate table across all 5 years for both stocks


# Question 3.1 =================================================================================================
# TODO: What are the best and worst weeks from tables generated in last question


# Question 3.2 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Are these the same weeks for both stocks?


# Question 3.3 =================================================================================================
# TODO: For each of the weeks in your original weeks file, how many were outside the standard deviation?
	# See PDF for equation


# Question 4.1 =================================================================================================
# TODO: You trade each week perfectly with CMG, starting with $100, how much do you make after 5 years?


# Question 4.2 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Same as 4.1 except for SPY


# Question 4.3 =================================================================================================
# TODO: How long would it take for your stock and SPY to make $176 starting from $100


# Question 5.1 =================================================================================================
# TODO: for both stocks, how much will you make with buy and hold?


# Question 5.2 =================================================================================================
# TODO: How does the results of 5.1 compare to 4


# Question 5.3 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Buy and hold except you put it into cash at end of may, and back into stock on last day of august
	# Summarize in table, see PDF


# Question 5.4 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Both stocks, buy and hold 12 times, except each time, for one month of the year, sell on the first trading
# day of that month, and buy on the last trading day of that month
	# Summarize in table, see PDF


# Question 6 =================================================================================================
# TODO: For both stocks trade each week with the oracle
# Generate random number r between 0 and 1, if p >= r, the oracle predicts true value, otherwise opposite
# Generate table doing this ten times for p = 0 to 1 with 0.1 steps


# Question 6.1 =================================================================================================
# TODO: What value of p equals buy and hold results?


# Question 6.2 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Any patterns in table from question 6?


# Question 7.1 =================================================================================================
# TODO: Compute table from question
